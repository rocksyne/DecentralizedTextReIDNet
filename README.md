# Decentralized Text-Based Person Re-Identification in Multi-Camera Networks
This is the code repository for the paper titled "Decentralized Text-Based Person Re-Identification in Multi-Camera Networks". The repository contains the implementation of U-TextReIDNet and its decentralized deployment in multi-camera networks. The prototype system addresses limitations in scalability, bandwidth usage, and processing bottlenecks typically found in traditional centralized systems by enabling person re-ID directly at the camera node level.
